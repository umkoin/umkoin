==================

Umkoin Core version 22.0 is now available from:

  <http://www.umkoin.org/bin/umkoin-core-22.0/>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/umkoin/umkoin/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Umkoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `umkoind`/`umkoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Umkoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Umkoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Umkoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer. Umkoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Umkoin Core on
unsupported systems.

From Umkoin Core 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported.
