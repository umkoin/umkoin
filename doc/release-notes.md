*After branching off for a major version release of Umkoin Core, use this
template to create the initial release notes draft.*

*The release notes draft is a temporary file that can be added to by anyone. See
[/doc/developer-notes.md#release-notes](/doc/developer-notes.md#release-notes)
for the process.*

*Create the draft, named* "*version* Release Notes Draft"
*(e.g. "22.0 Release Notes Draft")*

*Before the final release, move the notes back to this git repository.*

*version* Release Notes Draft
===============================

Umkoin Core version *version* is now available from:

  <http://www.umkoin.org/bin/umkoin-core-*version*/>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/umkoin/umkoin/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Umkoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `umkoind`/`umkoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Umkoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Umkoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Umkoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Umkoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Umkoin Core on
unsupported systems.

Notable changes
===============

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

- A umkoind node will no longer rumour addresses to inbound peers by default.
  They will become eligible for address gossip after sending an ADDR, ADDRV2,
  or GETADDR message. (#21528)

Rescan startup parameter removed
--------------------------------

The `-rescan` startup parameter has been removed. Wallets which require
rescanning due to corruption will still be rescanned on startup.
Otherwise, please use the `rescanblockchain` RPC to trigger a rescan. (#23123)

Updated RPCs
------------

- The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` configuration option has been removed.  RPCs
  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `decodescript`,
  `gettransaction verbose=true` and REST endpoints `/rest/tx`, `/rest/getutxos`,
  `/rest/block` no longer return the `addresses` and `reqSigs` fields, which
  were previously deprecated in 22.0. (#22650)

- `listunspent` now includes `ancestorcount`, `ancestorsize`, and
  `ancestorfees` for each transaction output that is still in the mempool.
  (#12677)

- `lockunspent` now optionally takes a third parameter, `persistent`, which
  causes the lock to be written persistently to the wallet database. This
  allows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes. (#23065)

New RPCs
--------

Build System
------------

Files
-----

* On startup, the list of banned hosts and networks (via `setban` RPC) in
  `banlist.dat` is ignored and only `banlist.json` is considered. Umkoin Core
  version 22.x is the only version that can read `banlist.dat` and also write
  it to `banlist.json`. If `banlist.json` already exists, version 22.x will not
  try to translate the `banlist.dat` into json. After an upgrade, `listbanned`
  can be used to double check the parsed entries. (#22570)

New settings
------------

Updated settings
----------------

- In previous releases, the meaning of the command line option
  `-persistmempool` (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool
  persistence.  `-persistmempool` is now treated like other boolean options to
  mean `-persistmempool=1`. Passing `-persistmempool=0`, `-persistmempool=1`
  and `-nopersistmempool` is unaffected. (#23061)

Tools and Utilities
-------------------

- Update `-getinfo` to return data in a user-friendly format that also reduces vertical space. (#21832)

- CLI `-addrinfo` now returns a single field for the number of `onion` addresses
  known to the node instead of separate `torv2` and `torv3` fields, as support
  for Tor V2 addresses was removed from Umkoin Core in 22.0. (#22544)

Wallet
------

GUI changes
-----------

- UTXOs which are locked via the GUI are now stored persistently in the
  wallet database, so are not lost on node shutdown or crash. (#23065)

Low-level changes
=================

RPC
---

- `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain tip time. (#22407)

Tests
-----

- For the `regtest` network the activation heights of several softforks were
  set to block height 1. They can be changed by the runtime setting
  `-testactivationheight=name@height`. (#22818)
