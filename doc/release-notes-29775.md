Testnet4/BIP94 support
-----

Support for Testnet4 as specified in [BIP94](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0094.mediawiki)
has been added. The network can be selected with the `-testnet4` option and
the section header is also named `[testnet4]`.

While the intention is to phase out support for Testnet3 in an upcoming
version, support for it is still available via the known options in this
release.
