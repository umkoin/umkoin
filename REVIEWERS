# ==============================================================================

# As Umkoin Core is directly derived from Bitcoin Core project so the code it
# uses and is continuously synchronized with is owned by respective Bitcoin Core
# Team developers/contributors. The meaning of this file is to rather configure
# inner ownership for code review when someone opens a pull request directly in
# Umkoin Core repository.

# Configuration of the code ownership and review approvals for the Umkoin Core
# repository. Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important: the last matching pattern takes the most precedence. More
# information on working mechanism and semantics can be found at:
