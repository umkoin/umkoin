# ==============================================================================

# As Umkoin Core is directly derived from Bitcoin Core project so the code it
# uses and is continuously synchronized with is owned by respective Bitcoin Core
# Team developers/contributors. The meaning of this file is to rather configure
# inner ownership for code review when someone opens a pull request directly in
# Umkoin Core repository.

# Configuration of the code ownership and review approvals for the Umkoin Core
# repository. Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is not important; if a modified file or directory matches a fnmatch,
# the reviewer will be mentioned in a PR comment requesting a review.

# Regular contributors are free to add their names to specific directories or
# files provided that they are willing to provide a review.

# Absence from this list should not be interpreted as a discouragement to
# review a pull request. Peer review is always welcome and is a critical
# component of the progress of the codebase. Information on peer review
# guidelines can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md doc.
